1. Factory pattern (for class creation)
2. Strategy pattern (for classes that use multiple algorithms - renting planning)
3. Observer pattern (update users on number of stations)
4. Visitor pattern (rides payment)
5. Singleton pattern (to classes that will have only one instance)
6. Observer pattern (terminal must be informed if the station is on service or not)
