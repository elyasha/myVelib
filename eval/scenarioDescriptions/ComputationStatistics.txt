Computation of statistics
1. the myVelib system stores relevant data in form of records representing N rental bike
simulations (by diferent users, on diferent stations, and with diferent duration)
2. the statistics (computed w.r.t. the rental records added in previous step) for each
user are displayed
3. the statistics (computed w.r.t. the rental records added in previous step) for each
station are displayed
4. stations are displayed sorted w.r.t. the most used station (first)
5. stations are displayed sorted w.r.t. the least occupied station (first)
